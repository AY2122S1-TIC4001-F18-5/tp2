# Contact Manager
This is an extension of AddressBook3 project.

Contact Manager is more than just software saving static contact information. It allows the user to assign tasks/todos to remind themself that there are certain tasks that the user needs to do for that contact.

Categorizing features, contacts saved in the Contact Manager, can be grouped/labeled for better organizing purposes. Users can use this software to do a quick search for a group of people who share the same information, e.g from the same company.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
