# Contact Manager
This is an extension of AddressBook3 project.

Contact Manager is more than just software saving static contact information. It allows the user to assign tasks/todos to remind themself that there are certain tasks that the user needs to do for that contact.

Categorizing features, contacts saved in the Contact Manager, can be grouped/labeled for better organizing purposes. Users can use this software to do a quick search for a group of people who share the same information, e.g from the same company.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Ensure Intellij JDK 11 is defined as an SDK**, as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) -- this step is not needed if you have used JDK 11 in a previous Intellij project.
2. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
3. **Verify the set up**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/duke/Duke.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
   ```
   > Task :compileJava
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes
   
   > Task :Duke.main()
   Hello from
    ____        _        
   |  _ \ _   _| | _____ 
   | | | | | | | |/ / _ \
   | |_| | |_| |   <  __/
   |____/ \__,_|_|\_\___|
   
   What is your name?
   ```
   Type some word and press enter to let the execution proceed to the end.
