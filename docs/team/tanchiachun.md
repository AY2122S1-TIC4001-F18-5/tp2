### Project: Contact Manager

Contact Manager is more than just software saving static contact information. It allows the user to assign tasks/to-dos/finance to remind themselves that there are certain actions that the user needs to do for that contact, with enhanced group/search features.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Enhancements Implemented

1. Add `Money` to contacts as money owed.
1. Overview of total `Money` owed to all contacts, together with count of contacts.

#### Code contributed
